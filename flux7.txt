Assignment:
Ansible ( 2.5+) has recently released a module for terraform. Please create an Ansible playbook to deploy terraform projects including deciding appropriate parameters to provide a good balance between usability and customisability. This playbook is intended to be run within a Jenkins pipeline.


Think about it as a generic playbook to deploy any terraform project. The idea is to have various capabilities like
  - Ability to set backend configuration during runtime - done.
  - Ability to pass terraform variables through ansible vars - done

Have a way to create:
   - 	Only terraform plan and not execute it  (for example, this can be used to create a manual approval stage) - done
   - 	Create the plan and execute it - done
   - 	Just execute a plan that has been created earlier - done

If you think the new module lacks these capabilities. please mention them in detail.
